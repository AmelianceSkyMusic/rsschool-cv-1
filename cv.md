## About Me

I used to be a design engineer at a factory and later I have decided I want to work with Web. I have started my path as a web designer and a digital artist. Later I have realized I am more interested in the engineering part of Web so I have decided to be a frontend engineer and I believe that I have all the necessary skills to succeed. I have a high ability to learn and to stay motivated during the learning process. I am a highly responsible and friendly person who enjoys teamwork.

## Skills

- HTML, CSS

## Code example

**Solution of kata from Codewars:**
Create a function that takes a string name as an argument and returns the first 3 or 4 letters as a nickname. If the 3rd letter is a consonant, return the first 3 letters. If the 3rd letter is a vowel, return the first 4 letters.

```
function nicknameGenerator(name){
  if (name.length < 4) {
  return "Error: Name too short";
  }  
  const vow = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
  let nick = vow.includes(name[2]) ? 4 : 3;
  return name.slice(0, nick);   
}
```
